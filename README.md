# h5pulsar

Allow Enterprise pulsars to be written to and read from HDF5 files. Especially
when timing packages like Tempo2 or PINT are either not available or very slow,
this can be a big aid.

# Installation

The h5pulsar add-on to Enterprise can be installed straight from github using

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/vhaasteren/h5pulsar.git
```

# From Pypi, you can do:
NOTE: not uploaded to Pypi yet

```bash
pip install h5pulsar
```

# Conda

```bash
conda install h5pulsar
```
